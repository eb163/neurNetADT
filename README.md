# neurNetADT
An implementation I came up with for a Neural Network using the object-oriented design strategies of inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. This was a project developed in my free time as a hobby to help me better understand neural networks. 

It's not completely finished yet. I still need to implement a learning algorithm, and since I initally started this project I've learned more memory efficient strategies for implementing tree-like structures such as neural nets. In the future I may go back and branch off and redesign the class for more efficient use of memory.
